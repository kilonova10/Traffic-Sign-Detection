# Traffic-Sign-Detection

## This is a computer vision project built around the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree
## it revolves around building a model smart enough to detect and differentiate between 45 different kinds of traffic signs

A LeNet CNN architecture is developed in TensorFlow, with 98.8% accuracy on the training set, 94.1% on the validation set and 100% on the sample test set of images of traffic signs found around on the internet (just 8 images but it looks nice at least)
